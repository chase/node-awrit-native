/**
UTF-8 is a variable length character encoding. To decode a character one or more
bytes have to be read from a string. The decode function implements a single
step in this process. It takes two parameters maintaining state and a byte, and
returns the state achieved after processing the byte. Specifically, it returns
the value UTF8_ACCEPT (0) if enough bytes have been read for a character,
UTF8_REJECT (1) if the byte is not allowed to occur at its position, and some
other positive value if more bytes have to be read.

When decoding the first byte of a string, the caller must set the state variable
to UTF8_ACCEPT. If, after decoding one or more bytes the state UTF8_ACCEPT is
reached again, then the decoded Unicode character value is available through the
codep parameter. If the state UTF8_REJECT is entered, that state will never be
exited unless the caller intervenes. See the examples below for more information
on usage and error handling, and the section on implementation details for how
the decoder is constructed.
